Guessing game. Write a c++ game that asks the user to guess a number between two numbers. 
If you guessed correctly, it will say you win. If your too high or too low it will also let you know.


- score X -> record system (with 3 letter alias) -> savefile


BUGS:
- tries dont reset after the game ends - FIXED
- letters(input) crash program mid-game // check for type of input - FIXED
- more than one char(input) does strange things to menu - FIXED
