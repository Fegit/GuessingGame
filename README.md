# GuessingGame

Commandline GuessingGame 

main.cpp, Game.cpp, Game.h

Description: Commandline GuessingGame with menu and highscore system (highscore system not yet implemented)

Ideas:
- save highscores in seperate file w/ 3 letter aliases -> hash the file to counteract "cheating through text-editing"
- push scores into an sql database to display scores through a webpage
